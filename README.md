## VAR-Estimation-Report
This is the final report written for the project, outlining key challenges and decomposing how the overall project was navigated. 

## FTSE AND FCHI DATA
Excel file containing data regarding the performance of all the different iterations of models that were checked. The data is sorted by BIC value. Columns that are green signify that they have passed the corresponding test according to the significance levels that were set.

-Ljung–Box test (autocorrelation)
-Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (normal)
-Anderson–Darling test (normal)

## VAR-ESTIMATION-MARKDOWN
Contains all code used to write the final report.
